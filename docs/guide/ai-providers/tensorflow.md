## Supported Models on Dialoqbase

We use `universal-sentence-encoder-lite` model for embedding. You can find more information about the model [here](https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/tfjs-model/universal-sentence-encoder-lite/1/default/1). Model by default use `cpu` for embedding which may be slow in some cases.


## API Key

Tensorflow models not requires an API key which use your `cpu` for embedding.


## How to get API Key

You don't need to get an API key for Tensorflow models.
