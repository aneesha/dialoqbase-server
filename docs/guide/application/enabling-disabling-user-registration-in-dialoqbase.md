# Enabling/Disabling User Registration in Dialoqbase

## Introduction

In Dialoqbase version `v1.0.0` or above, administrators have the capability to control user registration settings. This feature allows administrators to easily enable or disable user registration based on their organization's needs. This document will guide you through the steps to enable or disable user registration within Dialoqbase.

## Prerequisites

- Access to a Dialoqbase account with administrative privileges.
- Dialoqbase version `v1.0.0` or a newer version.

## Enabling/Disabling User Registration

To enable or disable user registration, follow these steps:

1. **Log In**: Open your web browser and navigate to the Dialoqbase login page. Log in to your Dialoqbase account using your administrator credentials.

2. **Accessing Settings**: Once you are logged in, click on your profile picture in the top right-hand corner of the application. In the dropdown menu, select "Settings."


3. **Application Settings**: In the Settings menu, locate and click on "Application".

4. **Toggle User Registration**: In the Application settings, you will find an option labeled `Allow user to register`. This toggle switch controls whether users can register for accounts on your dialoqbase instance.

    - If the toggle switch is in the **ON** position (usually indicated by a blue color or the word "Enabled"), it means that user registration is currently allowed.

    - If the toggle switch is in the **OFF** position (usually indicated by a white color or the word "Disabled"), it means that user registration is currently disabled.

5. **Save Changes**: To apply your preference, click on the toggle switch to turn it **ON** or **OFF** as desired. After making your selection, be sure to save the changes. Look for a "Save" or "Apply" button in the settings panel and click on it.
