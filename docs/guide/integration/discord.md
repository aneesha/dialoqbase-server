# Discord (beta)

Integrating discord with dialoqbase is very easy. You just need to create a discord bot and provide the token to dialoqbase and dialoqbase will take care of the rest.

## Enable Discord Channel

To enable the Discord channel, you need to provide the Discord bot token to dialoqbase along with slash command. You can get the token by creating a Discord bot.


## Create a Discord Bot


To create a Discord bot, you need to have a Discord account. If you don't have one, you can create one [here](https://discord.com/).


Once you have a Discord account, you can create a Discord bot by following these steps:


## Step 1: Create a Discord Bot

Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and click on `New Application` button. You will be asked to provide a name for your bot. You can choose any name you want.  After that, click on the `Create` button.


## Step 2:  Retrieve Your Token

Your next step is to go over the menu on the left side of the screen and click “Bot”. It’s the icon that looks like a little puzzle piece.

Finally, click the "Copy" button next to the bot's avatar to copy the token to your clipboard. Then you can paste this into Discord Bot Studio in the token field on the Setup page.

If there is no "Copy" button, you can click the "Click to Reveal Token" button, and then copy the token that appears.


## Step 3: Provide the Discord Bot Token to dialoqbase


Once you have copied the token, you need to provide it to dialoqbase. You can do this by going to the `Integration` page and clicking on the `Discord` button. You will be asked to provide the token. You can paste the token you copied in the previous step.


That's it! You have successfully enabled the Discord channel for your bot. You can now interact with your bot through Discord.


## Step 4: Add your bot to your server

It's easy to add your bot to your server. Just click on the Discord button on the Integration page and you will see `Add to Server` button. It will redirect you to the Discord website where you can select the server you want to add your bot to.
