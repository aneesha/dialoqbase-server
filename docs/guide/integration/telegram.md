# Telegram

The Telegram Channel feature allows users to interact with your bot through Telegram. This documentation provides a step-by-step guide on how to create and set up the Telegram channel for your bot.


> **Note:** This feature is currently in beta. If you encounter any issues, please report them to us on our [GitHub](https://github.com/n4ze3m/dialoqbase/issues/new)


## Enable Telegram Channel 

To enable the Telegram channel, you need to provide the Telegram bot token to dialoqbase. You can get the token by creating a Telegram bot.

## Create a Telegram Bot

To create a Telegram bot, you need to have a Telegram account. If you don't have one, you can create one [here](https://telegram.org/).

Once you have a Telegram account, you can create a Telegram bot by following these steps:

## Step 1: Create a Telegram Bot

To create a Telegram bot, you need to send a message to the [BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) bot. You can do this by clicking on the link or by searching for `@BotFather` in the Telegram app.

Once you have opened the BotFather bot, you need to send the `/newbot` command to the bot. You will be asked to provide a name for your bot. You can choose any name you want. Once you have provided the name, you will be asked to provide a username for your bot. The username must end with `bot`. For example, `my_bot` or `my_bot_123`.


## Step 2: Get the Telegram Bot Token

Once you have created the bot, you will be given a token. You need to copy this token and provide it to dialoqbase. You can do this by clicking on the `Copy` button next to the token.


## Step 3: Provide the Telegram Bot Token to dialoqbase

Once you have copied the token, you need to provide it to dialoqbase. You can do this by going to the `Integration` page and clicking on the `Telegram` button. You will be asked to provide the token. You can paste the token you copied in the previous step.

That's it! You have successfully enabled the Telegram channel for your bot. You can now interact with your bot through Telegram.
